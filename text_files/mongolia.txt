Mongolia (/mɒnˈɡoʊliə/ (About this soundlisten), Mongolian: Монгол Улс Mongol Uls, Traditional Mongolian: Monggol ulus.svg[a] Moŋğol ulus; literally "Mongol Nation" or "State of Mongolia"), is a landlocked country in East Asia. It is sandwiched between Russia to the north and China to the south, where it neighbours the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Mongolia does not border Kazakhstan, although they are separated by only 37 kilometres (23 miles). It covers an area of 1,564,116 square kilometres (603,909 square miles), with a population of just 3.3 million, making it the world's most sparsely populated sovereign nation. Mongolia is the world's largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea, and much of its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to roughly half of the country's population.
